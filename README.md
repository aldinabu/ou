Option pricing using dynamic programming

The aim of this work is to bring together the method of dynamic programming relevant to option pricing. Dynamic
programming is a technique for solving dynamic optimization problems with a recursive structure. After introducing the
financial terms, such as options, we review the idea of dynamic programming and then discuss about solving option pricing
problem with dynamic programming approach. It is defined what is Bellmanâ€™s principle of optimality. The successful attempt to
price options is due to binomial trees. We propose a numerical procedure based on dynamic programming approach.
